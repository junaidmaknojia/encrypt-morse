# encrypt-morse

This intro app I am developing uses the current concept I am learning, binary trees, to traverse through the Morse tree and find the character the user wants. Through a series of screen taps and long-holds, the tree is searched using O(log(n)) time complexity and stored in an array to compile into an encrypted message!

The next updates after the code works to print a message is to design the screen to seem as if the phone is asleep, although your screen touches and holds are still registered. 

The last update, yet the hardest will be to make it interactive with other users using the internet to share a code and be able to send secret messages to each other using Morse Code!

Technology used: Android Studio (Java)
Concepts Employed: Binary trees, clickListeners
